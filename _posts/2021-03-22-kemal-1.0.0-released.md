Hello everyone,

[I'm](https://twitter.com/sdogruyol) super excited and happy to release Kemal 1.0 on my birthday (Mar 22) right after Crystal 1.0. It's the best birthday present I could ever wish for :birthday:

This release adds support for Crystal 1.0 and makes Kemal the first Crystal project to fully support Crystal 1.0. 

It's been a long ride and Kemal is 1.0 after:

- 733 Commits
- 601 Pull Requests
- 48 Releases
- 56 Contributors

and we're just starting :rocket:
